The Heist
=========

<p>The Heist is a gamemode based on PAYDAY: The Heist and PayDay 2. The game involves you joining with other players, forming crews and stealing from a multitude of places such as coffee shops, jewellery shops, banks and even the homes of the rich and greedy. </p>
<p>This won't be easy, as each heist has its own level of security. If you want a to do bigger heists you'll need to be prepared. The more stars the job has the harder it is and the more you'll have to get around to doing a successful heist. In heists such as banks, there will be armed guards and CCTV making it a lot harder for you to get in unseen.</p>
<p>Does The Heist offer anything other just plain old boring robbery you ask? Well, my friend, you're in luck. The Heist offers a plethora of missions such as prison escapes, police chases and firefights with cops and other players. </p>
<p>Jobs can be collected in The Rift by visiting local establishments. The Rift is renowned for being the host of a modern day Thieves Guild. You're new to the town, the jobs on offer will be limited at first. Once you've climbed the ranks and increased your reputation, more and more jobs will roll in. </p>
<p>To add a little spice to The Heist, we have added a Skill system and Upgrade shops, where you can earn XP from completing quests and jobs. The XP can be spent on making you walk faster, move quieter, reload faster  and a whole lot more. The upgrade shop allows you to buy new guns, knives, attachments to your weapons and more. </p>
